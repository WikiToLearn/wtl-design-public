WTL - Design
============

General information
-------------------

This is a public repo, it is meant to be used by wikitolearn design and 
promo teams as a way to share WTL branded material.

In this spirit we suggest not to gitignore any material here, so that
everything that has been created is quickly and easily shared, without 
the need of re-exporting.

Font
----

WTL logo uses DIN font, which is included in this repo.
You need to install it to properly open the svg files.
